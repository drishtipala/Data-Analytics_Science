The sales analysis on Superstore dataset is a study aimed at analyzing the sales performance of a fictional retail company called "Superstore".
The analysis utilizes a dataset containing information about sales transactions, customers, products, and geographical locations.
A superstore operating within the US has given us the task to identify what works best for them in terms of sales and making profit.

Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) we will help them identify: 
      (i) Their most and least profitable product categories
      (ii) Segment analysis of sales and profit
      (iii) Geographical analysis of sales and profit

Given the insights gained from the EDA, the superstore can choose to remove non-profitable products or invest in marketing efforts for products, segments and geographical areas that are driving their profit
